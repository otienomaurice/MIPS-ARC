# MIPS(Multi-processor without interlocked pipeline stages)-ARCITECTURE

The code in this repository will constitute c programs and assembly language programs written to run on PIC32MX128F250B processor. This is a 32-bit MIPS 
 based processor that can be used to do exciting things for students. Lafayette college designed a small line-following  robot known as lafbot whose brain uses the forementioned processor. 
 We shall write simple c programs  to control the lafbot so that it can follow a line. The library code and the schematic diagrams are provided for those interest. It is alwo worth noting that there is an anlog version off theis lafbot that is not built using a microcontroller.
